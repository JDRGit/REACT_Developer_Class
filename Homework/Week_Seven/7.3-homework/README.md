# React 7.3 - Homework - React State and Props

## State and Props

- Create an APP, Homepage, Header, Search Bar, EmployeeList and Employee List Item. 
- No functionality is needed just arrange it with components.



    In React, "state" refers to the data or variables that determine a component's behavior and render the user interface. 
    
    "Props" (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props allow components to communicate with each other and share information. While a component's state can change within itself, props are passed down from a parent component and cannot be modified by the child component. Both state and props are used to render the component's UI.
